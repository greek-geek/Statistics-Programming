Submit the following files:

1) Your R package, where you have added the standard errors of linear and logistic regression to the outputs of your functions. These functions can output a list where the first list element contains the coefficient vector and the second element contains the standard errors.

2) Completed Rcpp script for sweep and QR.

3) Completed R script for sweep, QR, ridge regression, spline regression.

4) For comparing R vs Cpp, QR vs sweep, please use spline regression, where the number of predictors is large. You can just report the time for you to finish the spline regression using the competing methods.


5) Plots of the fitted ridge regression and spline regression curves on top of the observed data points for different lambdas. Also plot the training and testing errors over a range of lambda values.
